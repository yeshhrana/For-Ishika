          <p>You did not want the proposal to be on a 6 inch screen. 
            So, I scaled the screen up to 15.6 inches. 
            <br>Jokes apart, I know nothing can mimic a real proposal, 
            but I put a lot of effort into designing and developing this website. 
            I had fun. The only thought that was pushing me throughout the development period was the 
            thought of making you smile and blush (a lot).
