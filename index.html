          <h3>Für Ishika</h3>
          <br>
          <p>I never got the opportunity to fall in love with the way you look at me, the way you stare, smile, breathe. I fell in love with you, unaware of the way you exist. 
            <br>And why can't I? Why can't I love you for no reason when people can hate for the same?
            <br>I fell for you the same way I learned how to ride a bike; scared but reckless. No training wheels or elbow pads. I wanted my scars to tell the story of how hard I fell.
            <br>I love you, Ishika. I'm confused, scared, and hesitant. But love is bravery, Ishika. A testament to how we continue to care for someone despite being aware of the hardships we might face.
            <br>Will you ever love me in the same way? I know I am tough to love. 
            Forever my life has been studded with trifling triumphs. But they don’t matter to me, they never did. Society lusts at men like me. But society doesn't matter; you do. 
            <br>Will you continue to love me if I get stripped off of those? 
            <br>Will you love me for no reason?
